# üîê Fortify ‚Äì Your Secure Password Vault

Fortify is a zero-knowledge, client-side encrypted password manager built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows you to securely store and manage sensitive information ‚Äî including login credentials, ATM PINs, banking passwords, and crypto wallet seeds ‚Äî with strong cryptography and modern authentication.

##  Features

-  Zero-knowledge encryption: only you can decrypt your data
-  Client-side AES-GCM encryption using master password
-  Master password never leaves your device
-  PBKDF2 or Argon2id for secure key derivation
-  Store multiple types of secrets:
  - Website credentials
  - ATM PINs (4 & 6 digits)
  - Internet banking passwords
  - Wallet passphrases
  - Crypto wallet seed phrases
-  Sign up ‚Üí Set master password flow
-  HTTP-only cookies for secure access/refresh token auth
-  Seamless auto-refresh token system
-  Protected routes with full CRUD for vault entries
-  Clean UI with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI
-  Responsive React + TypeScript frontend

## üîê Zero-Knowledge Encryption

Fortify is built with **zero-knowledge principles**, meaning **even the server cannot access your encrypted data**.

### How it works:
- Your **master password is never sent to the server**.
- It is used **in the browser** to derive an encryption key (via **PBKDF2** or **Argon2id**) along with a unique salt.
- All sensitive data is encrypted **client-side using AES-GCM** before being sent to the server.
- The server only stores **ciphertext**, never raw data or passwords.
- Even if your database is breached, **no one can decrypt your data without your master password**.
