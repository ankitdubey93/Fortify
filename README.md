üîê Fortify ‚Äì Your Secure Password Vault

You must proceed past the browser "Not Secure" warning to access the app.

Fortify is a zero-knowledge, client-side encrypted password manager built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Store, organize, and secure your most sensitive credentials with modern cryptography ‚Äì your secrets remain private, even if the server is compromised.

‚ú® Features
Zero-knowledge encryption:
Only you can decrypt your data; even the server cannot.

Client-side AES-GCM encryption:
All sensitive info (passwords, PINs, seeds) is AES-GCM encrypted before leaving your device.

Master password stays local:
Never transmitted‚Äîcryptographic keys derived in-browser (using PBKDF2 or Argon2id).

Diverse secret types:

Website credentials

ATM PINs (4 & 6 digits)

Internet banking passwords

Wallet passphrases

Crypto wallet seed phrases

Authentication:

Secure, HTTP-only cookie-based session management (JWT access/refresh tokens)

Seamless token refresh for enhanced UX

Protected API routes and CRUD for vault entries

Modern, responsive UI:

Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI for a clean, fast experience.

Password reset ability:

Reset from "Forgot Password" on the login page (sends a reset link to your email).

Alternatively, reset from "Accounts" while logged in: simply provide your old password and set a new one.

‚ö° Tech Stack
Frontend
React + TypeScript

Context API (for authentication and encryption state)

AES-GCM via Web Crypto API

PBKDF2 & Argon2id with argon2-browser

Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI components

Backend
Node.js + Express + TypeScript

MongoDB (with Mongoose)

Bcrypt for password hashing

JWT (access & refresh tokens)

HTTP-only cookie-based authentication

Robust session management & route protection

üîí How Zero-Knowledge Encryption Works
Master Password Never Leaves Your Browser:
Used to generate your encryption key locally.

Client-side Encryption:
Sensitive data is AES-GCM encrypted in-browser before transmission.

Unique Salt and Secure Key Derivation:
PBKDF2/Argon2id + per-user salt.

Only Ciphertext on Server:
Database breach? Attackers can‚Äôt decrypt a thing without your master password.

üö¶ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v18+)

MongoDB (local or Atlas/cloud)

Yarn or npm

1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fortify.git
cd fortify
Configure your .env files for backend and frontend as needed.

üîÑ New: Automatic GitHub Actions Deployment
The production deployment to AWS Lightsail (https://13.232.184.165) triggers automatically on each main branch push.

Code updates, builds, and Docker Compose restarts are handled by a CI workflow via SSH.

üîê Account & Password Recovery
Forgot your password? Use the "Forgot Password" link on the login page ‚Äì enter your email to receive a reset link.

Logged in, want to change your password?
Visit the Accounts page, enter your old password, and set a new one‚Äîsecure, no email needed.

üõ£Ô∏è Planned Features
Vault entry export/import (JSON, .kdbx)

Biometric login (WebAuthn)

PWA ‚Äì Offline vault use

Usage insights & access logs

Browser extension for autofill

Security first, privacy by design. Built for you, not for data harvesters.
